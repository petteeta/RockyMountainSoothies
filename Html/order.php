                    I've included the weight of  <span id="yellowFont">EACH</span> 
                    Soothie for you in case you want to 
                    know what your package will weigh. Remember to multiply that weight by 
                    the number of Soothies you order in each size. (i.e. if you order 4 
                    Medium, the weight would be 4 pounds,  plus 2 Jumbo, the weight would 
                    be 6 pounds. Your total package weight would be 10 pounds.) Then I 
                    have to add the distance to be shipped based on from my Zip Code to 
                    your Zip Code. Both USPS and UPS automatically calculate this when I 
                    enter the two Zip Codes and weight and that will give me your 
                    shipping cost.<br><br>
                    
                                      
                    Most Soothie products do not fit in the Flat Rate Shipping boxes. 
                    A lot of times a regular box with 2-3 Priority Mail is less 
                    expensive than the Flat Rate.  You can rest assured I always do my 
                    best to find the least expensive way to ship.

               <p id="order-paragraph">To place your Order for the Soothies you would 
               like, please follow the example below so I know exactly what you
               would like. Please be 
               sure to put at least 4 spaces between each section when
               entering your Order; otherwise when I receive your Order, it will
               all run together.  The EXAMPLE below shows the separation.
               <br><br>

               1.  Enter only <span id="yellowFont">ONE</span>  item 
               <span id="yellowFont">PER LINE</span>  in the "Order Details" box below.
               Be sure to fill in <span id="yellowFont">EACH</span> of the spaces in each 
               line.
               <br><br>
 
               2.  If any <span id="yellowFont">LETTERS</span> appear 
               <span id="yellowFont">BEFORE</span> the Fabric's Name, make sure you 
               include 
               those letters along with the <span id="yellowFont">FABRIC NAME
               </span>.  With over 200 bolts of 
               fabric without both these Identifier Codes and Fabric Names, it would 
               be very difficult for me to find the fabric(s) you order.  So take your 
               time and double check what you entered to make certain it matches what 
               is listed under the fabric swatch(s) that you have chosen.  When you are 
               shopping for your fabric, just have a pen and paper with you to jot 
               down the information then when you get to the Order Details box you 
               can simply enter your choices from your notes.<br><br>

               3.  Use the following format for EACH  line:<br>
                    Soothie Style - Letter - Color - Fabric Name - Quantity<br>
                    Remember to put at least 4 spaces between each
                    heading information as shown in the Example.</p><br>

          I use "The Square" to process all credit cards.  It's fast and easy and you 
               don't have to give me your credit card information.  (In this day and 
               age when identity theft is so prevalent, I prefer not to have any 
               credit card information other than my own).<br><br>
               
           When I receive your Order via email to me,  or by phone, Square will send 
               you an Invoice within 3-5 days.  It will contain what you ordered, 
               the cost of your 
               Soothie or Soothies, your shipping,  and my processing and handling fee 
               of $3.00.  On the Invoice it will say 
               <span id="yellowFont">Payment Due Upon Receipt</span>.  
               This immediate DUE DATE is to simulate youir paying by credit 
               over the phone when you place an order in that manner with Catalogs.    
               All you need to do is pay your Invoice by entering your credit 
               card information on the Invoice and 
               <span id="yellowFont">CLICK SEND</span>.  It will be sent right back to  
               Square.  Upon 
               receipt of your payment to Square, I will get a notice from Square 
               letting me know you paid for your order, and you will receive a Receipt 
               for your payment. I will then make your order 
               and ship it out to you.  <span id="yellowFont">PLEASE NOTE:</span> 
               If Square has not received  your payment 
               in 7 days, THEY will send you and I an Order Cancellation Notice. 
               Your order will not ship until payment has been received. 
               I can't do anything about that.  That just is the way Square does 
               their Invoicing.  I realize you may be out of town on business, or 
               on vacation.  If you get a Invoice Cancellation Notice, not to worry, 
               send me an email or give me a call and I can have the Invoice re-issued. 
               Your order will ship within 2-4 days after notification of payment. 
               Orders usually ship within a couple days unless there is a  week-end or 
               a holiday to deal with.<br><br>
  

          Checks are also welcome here but do remember that it takes approximately up 
               to two weeks additional time to get your order. When your check arrives 
               (it usually takes about 5-7 days depending on how far you are away 
               from me), 
               then your check has to be verified by your bank which usually takes up to 
               3 days (gotta deal with weekends).  Then it takes 
               anywhere from 3-6 days for your Soothie to arrive at your door.<br><br>

      <p id="order-paragraph">When you Click the "Email Order" button above, a 
          pre-addressed E-Mail addressed to Rocky Mountain Soothies will open on 
          your computer screen, with your Order information inserted all ready to be 
          sent to me.  All you need to do is <span id="yellowFont">CLICK</span> on 
          Your E-Mail  "Send"  Button.  
          That's it!  Your Order  is instantly placed with us. Pretty cool, huh!!!  
          Should I have a question about your order, I will give you a call.<br><br>
           
<!-- 
          (<span id="yellowFont">406.755.6511</span>) during regular business hours 
          (<span id="yellowFont">MOUNTAIN TIME</span>) to review your order to make 
          sure what you entered is what you 
          ordered (sometimes people inadvertently turn letters and numbers around and I 
          don't want you to get your order and it not be what you meant to order. 
          So our phone conversation makes certain that does not happen.  I have tried to 
          avoid having this happen by not using any numbers for you to have to deal 
          with).  Also this conversation will also tell you if I have sufficient fabric 
          in stock in the designs you choose. I may have enough to make a Wrap but not 
          enough to make a Large Warming Pad. Between on-line orders, walk-in 
          customers, and retail customers, fabric turns over fairly quickly.  I do 
          my best to keep my Fabric Swatches page updated when fabric has sold out 
          or has been discontinued.  In 12 years I have not had one unhappy customer 
          and I aim to keep it that way!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

     Also when you call me you then will choose your method of payment. Your order will then 
          be processed and will ship as soon as possible.  Remember I make orders in 
          the order I received them. That the fairest way I can do this.<br><br>
