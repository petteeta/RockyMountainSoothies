               Every January Many Flannels Go On CLEARANCE To Reduce Inventory Amounts. 
               It's a Good Chance For You To Pick Up Extra Soothies For Yourself or To 
               Put In Your "Gift Closet" For When You Need a Quick Gift For Someone 
               Such As Birthdays, Mother's and Father's Days, Grandparents Day, 
               Easter, Baby Showers, Christmas, Secret Santa, Office Gifts, or 
               Just Because.<br>
               The Annual Clearance Goes Away the End of February   so stock up now.
               There are no Clearance Flannels in The Men's Store as We Just Had our 
               Grand Opening For Our Men's Store.

               This month we are featuring the Desert Southwest.  The beautiful flannel is rich in the colors of this
                     part 
                    of our Country and captures some of the native designs from the land's people and the shadings in the 
                    colors are gorgeous.  The camera doesn't do it justice.  It's done in the top-of-the-line high quality 
                    flannel we are known for using and super, super soft.  If your home decor is done in Desert Southwest 
                    this design will be right at home with you.  The Wrap style has the solid co-ordinating backing you see 
                    here that adds even more richness to this style.  This Desert Southwest beauty can be found in the 
                    Swatch Gallery under Prints Category at P-BRN-SOUTHWESTERN.

          SOOTHIE WARMING PADS ARE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED</span></h2><br><br>

<p>What sets a Soothie product apart from Grandma's smelly old rice bags of years 
     gone by, and the knock off wanna bees out there now, is that Soothies make their 
     own moist heat and they are perfectly safe to use. You see, to get moist heat 
     from the old rice bag and from other grains like buckwheat and corn, you had to 
     either set a bowl of water in the micro wave or dampen the bag itself to get it 
     to make moistness. After several uses of this process, people were getting headaches 
     and not feeling well but kept using these rice  bags. What was happening was that 
     after several uses these bags were producing MOLD and wearing the bag around the 
     shoulders, the moisture being emitted was being breathed in. (Read about this on 
     my <span id="yellowFont">"About Us"</span> page).  It took me a long time to find 
     something that could make its own moist heat without growing mold and was safe to 
     use on every "body" from small infants to the very elderly while at the same time 
     it had to be non-toxic, and above all, if the family dog or cat gets a hold of a 
     Soothie, tears it open and eats some filling, it would not hurt them, or any person 
     of any age.</p><br>


<p>Our Wrap can be used flat and smooth on flat places of the body like the electric 
     heating pad, but that's totally where the similarity stops. The Wrap is flexible, 
     scrunchable, counter-balanced so it stays put right where you put it, AND... 
     no electrical cord to tether you to a wall plug. It's 1 pound, 9 ounce weight 
     is perfect to push the warm, moist heat right into where it needs to go. It can 
     go with you to the office, while traveling, to visit family and friends,  
     gatherings, anywhere there is access to a microwave.</p><br>
  

<p>The uniqueness of the Wrap is that is that it can go beyond the neck and shoulders  
     because of its shape and design.  It can lay on the upper back between the 
     shoulders and stay right there while you move about doing things.  
     With an electric heating pad, you have to lay down and stay there while 
     putting that dry heat on the upper back area.  That takes time out of your 
     day you most likely just don't have. It is also adjustable so you can get 
     it spot on where it needs to be.</p><br>
   

<p>Lower back problems can also be treated with the Wrap.  Simply scrunch it up and 
     put your pants, jeans, shorts, or sweats on letting the waistband hold it 
     in place while you move about the house, drive or ride in the car, or at the office. 
     Athletes, both pro and the week-end warrior ones,  can take the Wrap with them to 
     the course or the court, and as soon as they finish their game, heat the Wrap in 
     a microwave there and get it on the lower back area or around the neck and 
     shoulder area, getting the treatment started before you ever get home. Most of 
     the time the sooner you get heat or cold on something, your ahead of the game.  
     Tired muscles love the Soothie. Heat a Wrap before you leave and place it on your 
     thighs while you drive home if the legs are aching. Runners, joggers, walkers, 
     cyclists all need to "warm up" the leg muscles before doing their thing. The Wrap 
     can do that for you with its moist heat.  The Soothie Wrap will be your 
     <span id="yellowFont">GO TO</span> companion time and again.  Keep one in the freezer 
     so it will be cold and ready to go when you need to reduce swelling, headaches, 
     and more.</p><br>


<p>Now the WARMING PADS do the same thing but they are designed to treat larger areas 
     of soreness, aches, and pain than the Wrap,  and have more weight to them so they 
     can do THEIR job. They are flat rectangular shape pads (like the age old heating 
     pad that tries and tries but continually fails to come of age).  As the Wrap, the 
     Warming Pads are extremely flexible but they have more weight to them so they can 
     force the warm, moist heat to penetrate even more deeply into the areas of hurt. 
     The Warming Pads are available in Medium, Large, Jumbo and The Montana sizes, 
     weighing 1, 2, 3 and 4 pounds respectively.  
     </p><br>


<p>The Medium Warming Pad is primarily used for little places that the larger ones are too 
     big or too heavy for. This one can nicely be used (hot or cold) for headaches, ear aches, 
     as an eye soother when you freeze it. Use it on the top of your hands and wrists to 
     relieve arthritis ache, or to keep wrists warm and loose while you spend long hours on 
     the computer.  A lot of my customers tell me they take the larger sizes to bed with 
     them to snuggled up with to keep them warm under the cold sheets when it starts getting 
     cold outside. Soothies are quite the cuddler!!!!</p><br>
  

<p>And oh by the way, I use only high quality, super soft flannels for the 
     entire Soothie line.</p><br>















<p>Now here is something very important that you should know: There is a BIG difference between heat produced by a heating pad and the warm, moist heat produced by a Soothie.  Heat coming from a heating pad is a very dry heat and it does not penetrate into the ache.  Basically all a heating pad is good for is to warm you.  A Soothie, however, produces safe, warm, moist heat, and it is that warm, moist heat that penetrates deep into the area of hurt or pain to give you the much needed relief you strive for.</p><br>

<p>And what's more, as mentioned above, Soothies have no electrical parts and no cord. You are not tethered to only 4 feet of mobility. No cord to get tangled up in a recliner or the bedding. No cord to get wrapped around your neck while sleeping. And you can't burn yourself by falling asleep  with a heating pad on high all night.  A Soothie shuts itself off after about 25 minutes.  It's safe for young children falling asleep with something warm on a cold night, all the way up to our elderly folks.</p><br>

<p>While there are now mass produced copy cats and look-a-likes out there, 
          Soothies<sup>&#174;</sup> 
          are far and above what you will find in box stores, grocery stores and in catalogs.  
          Soothies<sup>&#174;</sup> are the best Wraps and Warming Pads you will find 
          anywhere. <span id="yellowFont">GUARANTEED</SPAN>.  
          They are <span id="yellowFont">NOT</SPAN> your "grandma's smelly old rice bags" 
          of long ago. 
          These are designer therapeutic Moist Heat Wraps and Warming Pads, all handmade, 
          one at a 
          time, by me.  You get exactly what <span id="yellowFont">YOU</span> want; not 
          what you have to take at a box store or in catalogs (And who knows what they are 
          filled with!!! Is it toxic, is it safe, does it cause mold to grow?).  
          You choose the color and the design pattern you want and I make it for you.  
          What a great personalized gift to give everyone on your Christmas List!!! 
          And they won't break your budget!</p><br>
           
<p>I have no employees because I want to be absolutely sure the 
          Soothies<sup>&#174;</sup> you order 
          are made right from start to finish. No cutting corners or skimping on the 
          amount of filling each Soothie<sup>&#174;</sup> must have. Rocky Mountain 
          Soothies<sup>&#174;</sup> prides 
          itself on quality, using the softest, top-of-the-line flannels, a non-toxic 
          odorless filling that makes its own moist heat, and every seam is triple 
          stitched. I know once you try a Soothie<sup>&#174;</sup>, you will never go 
          back to anything 
          you have purchased in the past that claims to be similar. The comparison will 
          blow you away.</p><br>
          
          
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span id="yellowFont"> HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU WILL GET THE 
     ORIGINAL SOOTHIES?</span></h2><br>          
          
     <p>Inside every one of my Soothie products, I have enclosed a little Instruction Booklet that tells you all about your Soothie, including the proper heating times for it, and how to take care of it so it will last you for a very long, long time.  But also tucked away inside, you will find a little "something extra".  If you purchase a similar item somewhere else claiming to be a Soothie, you will know you did not get the ORIGINAL Soothie if you do not find that little "something extra".</p><br>
