<span id="yellowFont">SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY is November 28th</span>.  
          Be sure to visit 
          my Webpage this day for 
          special sales for this <span id="yellowFont">ONE DAY ONLY</span> 
          nationwide event 
          to promote our country's 
          small businesses.  You'll find information about this event in the 
          <span id="yellowFont">"WHAT'S GOING ON HERE" CORNER</span>.  Start looking for 
          information about 
          this the week before Thanksgiving.  The specials will be posted on Small 
          Business Saturday, not a day before!!!<br><br>
          
     We will also have Christmas Specials running starting the week of 
          <span id="yellowFont">November 16th</span> 
          and running through <span id="yellowFont">December 22nd</span>.  Last year we 
          had "Gift Sets" that were 
          very popular and a little bird told me they will return this year.  And when 
          the weather turns cold Handwarmers make their appearance.</p><br><br>
